# Certificate4RDP

A program for applying certificates to Windows Remote Desktop.

## Description
- Converts certificates with a .pem extension issued by Letâ€™s Encrypt and similar providers into the PKCS#12 format used by Windows.
- Installs the certificate into the Windows certificate store and registers it in the registry.

## Usage
1. Add the public key (fullchain.pem) and private key (privkey.pem) to the Certbot folder.
2. Replace C:\Path_To_Certbot with the actual path to the Certbot folder.
3. Run run.bat with administrator privileges (the certificate file will be saved as output.pfx).
4. When the Windows Certificate Manager opens, grant Read permission to the NETWORK SERVICE user.
